## https://github.com/RenaKunisaki/hexchat-twitch

This is a Python script for use with HexChat, providing several enhancements for
Twitch.tv chat.

# Features:
* Map (some) Twitch emotes to Emoji characters
* Display users' correct name colours and capitalization
* Custom nick prefixes (resembling Twitch name badges) for e.g. Mod, Subscriber
* Display jtv/twitchnotify messages in the channel tab
* Display channel title, status, game and viewer count in the channel topic
* More to come...

# Usage:
* Copy the `twitch` directory and `twitch.py` script into your HexChat addons directory (something like `~/.config/hexchat/addons/twitch.py`)
* Use `/twitch help` until proper documentation is written...
* This script is still in development, so expect bugs.
